PROJECT TITLE:SHITHEAD
AUTHOR:Sam Cavenagh

EMAIL:cavenaghweb@hotmail.com
DESCRIPTION: Network Card Game

Overview:
I develop this program to extend my java skills and to implement something that to the 
best of my knowledge had not been done before.  I spend a good few months of my life 
working on this project and have implemented most of the functionality that I had foreseen
in my initial plans.  However, Shithead is a very adaptable game and many different versions 
of it exist.  I have received several emails requesting source code or changes to the 
program.  I myself feel I have spent enough time on this project and its time to move onto 
other work (such as uni).  Thus I am making the source code available to all who are brave 
enough to attempt to improve this program!!

Important Note:
I will be the first to admit that the code is not in the best form and large aspect of the 
program need to be re-architectured, however I do not have time to do this myself but if 
someone else wants to do it great.  I only have a few requests listed below.

1.	Any new versions of the program I would like to remain open source
2.	Improved versions are emailed to me so that can be added to my site for Shithead player 
    that don't have the time or skill to implement changes themselves
3.	I'm still given some form of credit for the program's creation (even if only as a footnote)
